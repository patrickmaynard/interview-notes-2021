— About how many Oregon Public Records Law requests have you made during your lifetime?

Five or six, all since 2018

— Do you remember what your first OPRL request may have been for, and when it was submitted? And was it successful? What did you use it for?

It was related to Portland’s Dept of Transportation’s request for proposals related to potential autonomous vehicle research here. It was successful in that I received documents related to what I requested but I never reported anything based on the information. 

— Could you describe any currently open Portland public document request(s) you’ve made? What do you hope to achieve with the request(s)?

I don’t have anything currently open at the time; however, I did just receive a batch of records I may report on. It’s information relevant to previous reporting I’ve done on the same subject for various publications.

— Have Portland city personnel been easy to work with? How has the process been so far?

In general, Portland city staff with the mayor, commissioners and at various agencies have always been willing to speak on background for a variety of stories and people at the agencies handling the records I’ve requested have been helpful but in a limited manner. In order to get certain information I’ve had to make records requests.

— Do you currently live in Portland? (If not, where do you live?) Did you grow up in Portland? What is your relationship with the city like? Any good memories?

I’ve lived in Portland for around six years. I own a home here and like many aspects of living here. I have a connection to and support local radio, music venues and underground culture more generally. I have read about aspects of the city’s history and keep up with local and state government and current events. I volunteered at Portland Audubon for a couple years and spent a lot of time as a volunteer DJ and reporter for XRAY.fm. Until pandemic lockdown, my partner worked at the Oregon Convention Center for Metro, a multi-county government agency.

— Do you remember what originally inspired you to start making public document requests? 

I sought more detailed information for story research I was not able to obtain from city and Metro staff.

— You’re a reporter, right? How would you describe your job? What inspired you to get into that line of work?

I’m a longtime tech reporter, yes. I’ve been both a staff reporter and freelance reporter during my time here in Portland, always working remotely for publications based in other cities. My job mainly entails speaking with people on the phone, conducting research and digging to find interesting, revelatory, important or enlightening information, then reporting it in digital article form or, at times producing radio or podcast stories. As a fulltime staff reporter currently, I cover tech platforms, data and privacy issues. 

I fell into journalism in the late 90s while working for a “dot com” that owned a small publication covering the digital marketing industry. I was hired there originally to code and publish articles – back before we had content management systems that’s how we did it. One thing led to another and I started reporting. I had some experience working at my HS newspaper but never had an interest in becoming a reporter. My natural curiosity, propensity for writing and entrepreneurial approach to work led me there. 

— What hobbies do you have? Do any of them intersect with your interest in public document requests? If so, how?

My hobbies typically don’t intersect with the tech, data and media issues I tend to address in my work, though much of my “free” time is spent reading or thinking about stuff that pertains to or informs my reporting. My hobbies are things like cooking and baking, hiking, reading, and various creative projects.

— The reason I’m doing this story is that Portland has the lowest success rate of the 50 biggest American cities when it comes to public document requests via MuckRock. If someone submits a request to Portland’s city government through that platform, it has only a 9.7% chance of being successful — a worse chance than in any other large city I examined. Portland is also the second-slowest at responding to public document requests. Does that information surprise you? Why or why not?

I don’t think I have enough experience dealing with Portland government necessarily to say I have a solid assessment of that finding. Maybe if anything it’s surprising because my limited experience has been relatively positive.

— Describe your daily routine a bit. Is there any part of it that inspired a document request at some point?
My daily routine is sitting at my home desk, reading and conducting research, interviewing sources and writing, usually taking a workout break. No, I’m pretty sure no personal situation ever inspired me filing a records request.

— What was the most useful public document request you ever made?
Two that I’ve filed in relation to local government’s use of a particular type of technology have been especially useful. One led to reporting that I won a first place Society of Professional Journalists tech reporting award for.

— Have you submitted any unsuccessful public document requests to the Portland city government or its sub-units? If so, could you describe those a little bit (assuming you haven’t already)? No, not that I recall.

— What else have I forgotten to ask? Are there any extra comments you would like to make?
For what it’s worth, I submitted an extensive records request with Oregon’s Bureau of Labor and Industries for an investigation that ultimately did not lead to me reporting a story. But the agency’s response was thorough and impressive. When information was redacted – mainly people’s names or other personal contact information in limited cases, it was explained in a separate document. The records staff was in regular contact and very responsive. 

My experience dealing with government here is actually far better in terms of responsiveness and general helpfulness than when I worked temporarily in 2019 an investigative journalist covering New York State related issues. 

One other thing: while I’ve always had an investigative approach to my work, it’s mostly been for business and tech pubs. The companies – unless they’re public - and issues I cover don’t have public records associated with them that are attainable via government. It’s a different world not assisted by nor reliant upon records requests.
