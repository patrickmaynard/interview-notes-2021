I took this issue up with our top city attorney that now oversees the PR process for the city, and she was able to shoot huge holes through much of the MuckRock data. The larger story is how MuckRock inaccurately tracks PRRs. Perhaps you should look into that. They’re making claims with their data, a lot of which is just plain inaccurate.
 
She looked at some of the data elements you shared and pointed out a vast amount of holes in how they track things. 
 
For example, their algorithms knock the City for not responding when the requester doesn’t make requests correctly and is told as much. It also frequently knocks the City for time when they are waiting for pay (which is not their fault) before releasing the information… which is part of Oregon’s Public Records Law. 
 
Below are some examples she flagged randomly while working with me, and a brief explanation above for each one. In the end, most of all examples she opened were flawed. We only spent 10-15 minutes on these..

 
Says awaiting response… we fulfilled on Feb. 13 and added documents.

Some that say waiting to respond is because we’re waiting for them to get back to us, as in this case.
